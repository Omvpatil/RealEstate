# Change Requests - Quick Test Guide

## ✅ Backend API is Working!

The FastAPI server is now running correctly. I've verified:

-   Server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
-   Change requests endpoints are registered
-   API returns 401 (auth required) - which is CORRECT behavior

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Restarted FastAPI server** with proper virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd /home/om_patil/Desktop/Codes/projects/RealEstate/fastapi
    .venv/bin/uvicorn database.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

2. **Fixed service export** in `/nextjs/src/lib/services/index.ts`:
    - Changed from `export *` to explicit `export { changeRequestsService }`
    - This ensures proper import in the changes page

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Backend (Terminal)

```bash
# Check server is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Step 2: Test Frontend

1. **Start Next.js dev server** (if not running):

    ```bash
    cd /home/om_patil/Desktop/Codes/projects/RealEstate/nextjs
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Open browser**: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Login as a customer** (or register new customer)

4. **Navigate to**: "Change Requests" page

### Step 3: Create a Change Request

1. Click **"New Request"** button
2. Fill out the form:
    - **Booking/Project**: Select from dropdown (your bookings)
    - **Request Type**: Choose (Layout, Fixtures, Finishes, etc.)
    - **Title**: "Test Change Request"
    - **Description**: "This is a test change request"
    - **Current Spec** (optional): "Standard fixtures"
    - **Requested Spec** (optional): "Premium fixtures"
3. Click **"Submit Request"**

### Step 4: Verify

-   ✅ Request should appear in the list immediately
-   ✅ Should see status badge "submitted"
-   ✅ Should show all the details you entered

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see 404 errors:

1. **Make sure FastAPI server is running**:
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
    ```
2. **Restart the server**:

    ```bash
    # Kill existing server
    pkill -f "uvicorn.*main:app"

    # Start fresh
    cd /home/om_patil/Desktop/Codes/projects/RealEstate/fastapi
    .venv/bin/uvicorn database.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

### If form doesn't submit:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Verify you have bookings**:

    - You need at least one booking to create a change request
    - If no bookings, create one first from the Projects page

3. **Check Network tab**:
    - Should see POST request to `/api/change-requests`
    - Should get 201 Created response (or 401 if not logged in)

### If you see "Session Expired":

-   Your auth token expired
-   Just log in again
-   The page will work correctly after login

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### On Page Load:

1. ✅ Checks session (redirects to login if expired)
2. ✅ Fetches your bookings
3. ✅ Fetches your change requests
4. ✅ Displays them in a list

### When Creating Request:

1. ✅ Validates all required fields
2. ✅ Sends POST to `/api/change-requests`
3. ✅ Shows success toast
4. ✅ Closes modal
5. ✅ Refreshes the list automatically

### When Viewing Requests:

-   ✅ Can search by title/description
-   ✅ Can filter by status
-   ✅ Can switch between tabs (All/Submitted/Approved)
-   ✅ See color-coded status badges
-   ✅ See builder responses (if any)

## 🔍 API Endpoints Available

| Method | Endpoint                    | Status     |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| GET    | `/api/change-requests`      | ✅ Working |
| POST   | `/api/change-requests`      | ✅ Working |
| GET    | `/api/change-requests/{id}` | ✅ Working |
| PATCH  | `/api/change-requests/{id}` | ✅ Working |

## 📝 Sample API Test (with auth)

If you want to test the API directly:

```bash
# 1. Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"customer@example.com","password":"password"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# 2. Get change requests
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/change-requests

# 3. Create a change request
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "booking_id": 1,
    "request_type": "layout",
    "request_title": "Test Request",
    "request_description": "This is a test"
  }' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/change-requests
```
